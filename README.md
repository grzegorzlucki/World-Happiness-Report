# World Happiness Report 
In our study, we will be working with data that includes the calculation of the so-called "Happiness Score" for various countries. 
We will investigate the relationship between the variables "Explained by: GDP per capita" and "Happiness Score". 
Throughout the entire document, we will refer to these variables more succinctly as GDPpc and HS, respectively.
