# World Happiness Report 
In our study, we will be working with data that includes the calculation of the so-called "Happiness Score" for various countries. 
We will investigate the relationship between the variables "Explained by: GDP per capita" and "Happiness Score". 
Throughout the entire document, we will refer to these variables more succinctly as GDPpc and HS, respectively.

### Basic Numerical Characteristics:

#### Measures of Central Tendency:
|       | Happiness Score | Explained by: GDP per capita |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Mean  | 5.554           | 1.410                         |
| Median| 5.569           | 1.446                         |
| Mode  | 5.377           | 1.815                         |

From Table 1, it can be observed that for the variable GDPpc, the mean is smaller than the median, and the median is smaller than the mode. This suggests an expected left-skewed distribution. However, for the variable HS, the median is slightly larger than the mean, but the mode is smaller than the mean. At this point, it is challenging to make assumptions about the skewness of this distribution.
